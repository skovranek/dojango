# DoJango
Do + Django = DoJango

[#DoJango_on_Heroku](https://dojango-2bea5c2d6d6c.herokuapp.com/)

## What
DoJango is yet another todo list web app. It demonstrates my knowledge of Python, Django and backend development.

## Why
I made DoJango to challenge myself to build a real functional web app using Python.

## How
It is a [Python](https://www.python.org/) [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) [web app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application) built with the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) framework, hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) with a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.

## Download/Install
## Configure
## Implement
## Testing
The website is manually tested to ensure the UI and backend function as expected.
